# Your compress function may sometimes give output that is actually longer than its input. In a
# comment, explain what is the largest number of bits that your compress algorithm could
# possibly use to encode a 64-bit string/image.
#
#
# The largest number of bits the compress algorithm would need to encode
# a 64-bit string/image is 64 * COMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE. So in the case of this
# assignment, that would be 64 * 5, which is 320. This would assume each bit is different from the last,
# so 1010...1010 or 0101...0101 would be examples where this would come up.

# 2nd comment
# Test your compression algorithm on several test images of your own design. In a
#comment, describe the tests that you conducted and the compression ratios that you found. You
#may find it useful to write some additional functions to help automate the testing of
#your compress algorithm. Here are a few test "images" that we are providing:
#
#
# I just used the given text examples to do this. It turns out that all of the
# cases here are actually bigger in size than they were. Although for some of the test cases
# on the actual test document, some of the compressed sizes were smaller. All of this is to say
# that the efficiency of our compression varies.

# 3rd comment
# Professor I. Lai from the Pasadena Institute of Technology (P.I.T.) has made the following claim
# to NASA: "I have developed a new image compression algorithm Laicompress(S) that takes a
# 64-bit string and always outputs a shorter string that represents that image. That is, every image
# is compressed at least somewhat by my algorithm. Of course, I also have Laiuncompressthat
# inverts the Laicompress algorithm so that Laiuncompress(Laicompress(S)) gives
# back S. In a comment, argue to NASA that Professor Lai is Lai-ingâ€”such an algorithm cannot
# exist! Try to make your reasoning as convincing and water-tight as possible. (In essence, you are
# proving that such an algorithm cannot exist.
#
#
# This function cannot exist because given this structure of compression,
# there will always be cases in which the string is longer than the original code.
# For example, if a string was basic ex: '10' * 32, it would need to account for
# each bit switch, which takes 5 bits per 1 bit in the original string.
# I'll also mention my knowledge from AP Computer Science Principles, and if 
# a sequence of letters/numbers/spaces/symbols/etc. never shows up more than once in
# a string, then it is already as compressed as can be.
# In short, unless our compression is constructed differently, it won't always be efficient.
